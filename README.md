# Project Overview

This project was completed in Excel. The purpose of this project was to take Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to determine if there is any loan approval bias towards minority applicants. This project was split into three sections: preparing the data, analyzing the data for possible bias, and performing an A/B test. A list of tasks that I completed in this project include:

- Used XLOOKUP to connect data between two tables and engineer new columns
- Created pivot tables to show loan approval and denial rates grouped by race and income group
- Created a histogram of applicant income with a detailed analysis of its distribution
- Created a null and alternative hypothesis to run an A/B test on the data
- Used an A/B test significance calculator to determine the statistical significance of the results of the A/B test
- Provided a final bias analysis based off the findings of the A/B test
